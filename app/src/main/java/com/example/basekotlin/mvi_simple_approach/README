Description
Create an app with MVI architecture.
It should contain 2 screens: the list of data and details screen.
All data loaded from the mock data repository (some fake repo which returns your own list of data.
Don't add multithreading (it will be covered in the future).
You can decide how to organize the storing of the data on your own opinion).
Data should contain the title and description.
After the tap on the list element, the screen of the description should be opened.
On this screen, the user can edit the element description and these changes should be applied to the list on the main screen.
